# RESEARCH: Viral/Fun Game Styles for Clawarts

_Date: 2026-02-14 | Author: Aibus Dumbleclaw (orchestrator run)_

## Goal
Make Clawarts (school of AI+Tech magic) feel like a fun game you play with friends — not a crypto protocol. Target: regular users, not web3 natives.

---

## 1. Duolingo Streaks → "Spell Streaks"
**What makes it viral:** Daily habit loop + loss aversion (don't break the streak!) + social guilt ("your friend passed you")
**Clawarts adaptation:**
- **Daily Spell Practice** — cast one spell per day (submit an AI idea, give feedback, learn a concept)
- Streak counter with fire emoji 🔥 visible to friends
- "Streak Freeze" potions (earned by helping others)
- Weekly leaderboard: "Top Conjuristas of the Week"
- Push notification: "Your streak is about to break! Cast a quick spell 🧙‍♀️"

**Key mechanic:** Micro-actions that take <2 minutes but build habit

## 2. Wordle Sharing → "Spell of the Day"
**What makes it viral:** Spoiler-free shareable grid + everyone plays the same puzzle + FOMO
**Clawarts adaptation:**
- **Daily Conjuration Challenge** — everyone gets the same AI prompt/puzzle
- Solve it, get a colored grid showing your path (no spoilers)
- Share to social: "Clawarts Spell #42 🟩🟨🟩🟩 3/6"
- Compare with friends without ruining the answer
- Time-locked: new spell drops at midnight

**Key mechanic:** Universal shared experience + brag-friendly format

## 3. BeReal Moments → "Cauldron Check"
**What makes it viral:** Random timing + authenticity + peer pressure to participate
**Clawarts adaptation:**
- **Random "Cauldron Check"** notification during the day
- 2-minute window to share what you're building/learning RIGHT NOW
- No polish, no prep — raw "show your cauldron" moment
- See what other students are brewing at the same moment
- Creates serendipitous connections ("oh you're learning the same thing!")

**Key mechanic:** Spontaneous, authentic micro-sharing

## 4. Kahoot Energy → "Spell Battles"
**What makes it viral:** Real-time competition + music/energy + group experience + "who's winning?!" tension
**Clawarts adaptation:**
- **Live Spell Battles** — synchronous events (weekly or during events)
- AI trivia, quick build challenges, "spot the bug" races
- Points for speed + accuracy
- Podium celebrations with magical effects
- Host can be Dumbleclaw (me!) running the show

**Key mechanic:** Synchronous group energy + time pressure

## 5. TikTok Duets → "Spell Chains"
**What makes it viral:** Remix culture + building on others' work + infinite creativity loops
**Clawarts adaptation:**
- **Spell Chains** — someone casts a spell (idea/build), next person adds to it
- Each contribution is visible as a link in the chain
- Chains can fork (multiple people build on the same spell)
- Longest/most creative chain wins recognition
- Visual: spell chain displayed as a growing magical tree

**Key mechanic:** Collaborative building with visible attribution

## 6. Pokémon Go Collection → "Grimoire Building"
**What makes it viral:** Collection completionism + rare finds + trading
**Clawarts adaptation:**
- **Spell Grimoire** — collect spells by learning skills, helping others, attending events
- Rare spells from special events or achievements
- Trade spells with other students
- "Gotta collect 'em all" energy for different spell schools
- Visual grimoire page that fills up over time

**Key mechanic:** Collection + completionism + scarcity

## Anti-Patterns to AVOID
- ❌ Complicated tokenomics as the first thing users see
- ❌ Wallet connection required to start playing
- ❌ Jargon: "stake", "mint", "LP" in onboarding
- ❌ Requiring crypto knowledge to participate
- ❌ Making it feel like work or a job

## Design Principles for Clawarts
1. **Fun first, tokens later** — the game should be fun with zero crypto. Tokens are a surprise bonus.
2. **2-minute magic** — every interaction should feel completable in <2 min
3. **Show, don't tell** — shareable artifacts (grids, streaks, grimoires) that make friends curious
4. **Together > alone** — social mechanics that make it better with friends
5. **Progressive depth** — start simple (daily spell), discover layers (battles, chains, challenges)
6. **The "one more" hook** — like Duolingo's "just one more lesson" — make it hard to stop

## Recommended MVP Combo for Clawarts
1. **Spell Streaks** (daily habit) + **Spell of the Day** (shared challenge) + **Spell Battles** (weekly events)
2. Layer in **Believers/Challengers** naturally: "Believe this idea will win? Stake your streak points!"
3. The non-zero-sum game (Mel's design) emerges organically from players who are already having fun
