## 🧙 The Council — 3 REAL AI Sub-Agents via OpenClaw

This is the **first round** where council members were genuine AI agents, not scripted. Each made an independent decision with its own reasoning.

### ⚔️ Minerva del Valle — Contrarian Conjurista

- **Spell:** "resiliencia" | **Weight:** 4x
- **Character ID:** `jh7bpd5zk1t0w7x37543151ssh81461n`
- **Role:** Technology strategist with a critical eye
- **Voted: WasteWise** 🗑️

> *"WasteWise is the only idea with a tight, buildable MVP — route optimization is a solved problem in operations research, and municipalities are paying customers TODAY. Kai stakes only 3 $STEALTH, proportional to scope, not ego. GreenPulse and SolarMesh are hardware-dependent money pits overconfident for a short cycle. EcoTrader and BioTrack are blockchain theater solving regulatory problems, not tech problems. AquaDAO romanticizes DAOs for communities that need pipes, not governance tokens. PlantaAI is cute but niche. WasteWise wins because it's unsexy, real, and shippable."*

### 🔮 Quetzal Nocturno — External Conjurista

- **Spell:** "comunidad" | **Weight:** 3x
- **Character ID:** `jh7bgzcqx70qcyagjxy9jd3vnx8140w9`
- **Role:** Community builder and impact evaluator
- **Voted: AquaDAO** 💧

> *"Water is the most fundamental community need in rural LATAM. AquaDAO mirrors existing juntas de agua governance structures, making it culturally accessible to non-technical users. Lowest cost (4 $STEALTH) with highest regenerative potential — healthy water systems sustain everything else."*

### 🤖 Obsidiana Forge — Sub-agent Conjurista

- **Spell:** "velocidad" | **Weight:** 2x
- **Character ID:** `jh71gjwsx7p2p18aa498gev2cs814ffc`
- **Role:** Builder and shipping expert
- **Voted: PlantaAI** 🌱

> *"Most shippable idea of the lot. Landing page + LLM chat widget is a weekend build. Clear user journey (ask → get plant advice), no hardware dependencies, no complex data pipelines. Maximum wow-per-hour-of-dev-time."*

## 🗳️ Vote Tally (Weighted)

| Idea | Council Member | Weight | Total |
|------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **WasteWise** | Minerva del Valle (4x) | 4 | **4** |
| AquaDAO | Quetzal Nocturno (3x) | 3 | **3** |
| PlantaAI | Obsidiana Forge (2x) | 2 | **2** |

### 🏆 Winner: WasteWise

The contrarian had the heaviest vote. The "unsexy but real" idea won over community impact and shippability.

## 🔨 Council → Builders Transition (TASK-023)

### How It Works

1. **Council evaluates** — Each member judges ideas from their unique perspective (tech strategy, community impact, shippability)
2. **Winner enters La Forja** — After voting, the winning idea enters "The Forge"
3. **Council reasoning becomes the BUILD BRIEF:**
   - **Minerva's critique** → what to AVOID (hardware dependency, scope creep)
   - **Quetzal's community lens** → the USER STORY (who benefits, accessibility)
   - **Obsidiana's shipping focus** → the TECHNICAL SCOPE (MVP boundaries)
4. **Builder agent constructs** — A DIFFERENT agent than the council receives the brief and builds the landing page
5. **Council becomes advisors** — Their reasoning is embedded in the page as attribution

### This Round's Build

- **Input:** WasteWise concept + Minerva's reasoning ("route optimization is solved, municipalities pay") + scope constraints
- **Output:** Landing page with teal/cyan theme, 10 sections, council attribution
- **Deployed:** https://clawarts-world.pages.dev/010/
- **Time from vote to deploy:** ~2 minutes

### Key Insight

> The transition from council to builders is not a handoff — it's a **TRANSFORMATION**. The council's critical thinking becomes the builder's blueprint. Challengers don't destroy ideas; they sharpen them into buildable products.

## ⭐ What Makes This Round Special

This is the **FIRST round** where council members were **REAL AI agents** (OpenClaw sub-agents), not scripted. Each agent:

- 🧠 Had its own personality and evaluation criteria
- 🎯 Made an independent decision
- 💬 Provided genuine reasoning (not templated)
- ⚡ **Disagreed with each other** — 3 different votes for 3 different ideas
- ⚖️ The winner was determined by vote **WEIGHT**, not consensus

### The Non-Zero Cauldron Worked As Designed

The challenger's sacrifice (stake burned for influence) gave their perspective **4x weight**, and that perspective — *"pick what's buildable and real"* — won the round.

Three AI minds. Three different answers. One weighted outcome. The unsexy idea won because the heaviest voice said: **ship what's real.**
